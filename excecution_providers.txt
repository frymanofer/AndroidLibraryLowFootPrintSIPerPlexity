Running on CPU (even with XNNPACK optimizations) is inherently
 less efficient than using DSPs, NPUs, or GPUs. Offloading 
 computations can lead to energy savings of up to
  50-80% per inference task.


Execution Provider	Hardware Dependency	Availability on Android Devices
ACL	ARM CPUs (Neon), Mali GPUs	Very High: Available on most ARM-based devices with or without Mali GPUs.
ArmNN	ARM CPUs (Neon), Mali GPUs, NPU	High: Available on ARM-based devices but limited by NPU presence.
QNN	Qualcomm Snapdragon Hexagon, Adreno GPUs	Very High: Common on devices using Snapdragon processors.

Steps to Build ONNX Runtime with ACL, ArmNN, and QNN Support
Clone ONNX Runtime Repository:

bash
git clone --recursive https://github.com/microsoft/onnxruntime.git
cd onnxruntime
Install Build Dependencies: Install required tools and libraries such as Python, CMake, Ninja, and compiler toolchains for cross-compilation.

Enable Providers in Build Configuration: Modify the build configuration to enable the desired providers:

bash
Copy code
./build.sh --config Release \
    --build_shared_lib \
    --use_acl \
    --use_armnn \
    --use_qnn \
    --armnn_lib_path=<path_to_armnn> \
    --acl_lib_path=<path_to_acl> \
    --qnn_lib_path=<path_to_qnn>
Cross-Compile for Android (if needed): Use Android NDK for building ONNX Runtime for ARM-based Android devices:

bash
Copy code
./build.sh --config Release \
    --android \
    --android_abi=arm64-v8a \
    --android_sdk_path=<path_to_sdk> \
    --use_acl --use_armnn --use_qnn
Test Your Build: Verify the build by running inference tests and ensuring the execution providers are successfully loaded.

1. ACL (ARM Compute Library)
License Requirements:
ACL is distributed under an open-source license (Apache License 2.0), so no special permissions or licenses are required to use it.
Dependencies:
You need to download and build the ARM Compute Library manually before integrating it with ONNX Runtime.
Download from the official GitHub repository: ARM Compute Library GitHub.
Caveats:https://github.com/ARM-software/ComputeLibrary
Building ACL requires specific dependencies such as CMake and a compiler supporting ARM Neon.
No license issues, but you may need time to configure and build the library.

ACL:
Samsung Galaxy series (Exynos variants).
MediaTek-powered devices like Xiaomi Redmi Note series.
Huawei devices with HiSilicon Kirin processors.

QNN:
Google Pixel (Snapdragon variants).
OnePlus, Xiaomi, and Samsung devices powered by Snapdragon processors.
Flagship and mid-range phones like the Samsung Galaxy S series (Snapdragon variants) or Xiaomi Mi series.
